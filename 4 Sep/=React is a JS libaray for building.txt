=>React is a JS libaray for building fast and interactive user interface for the web as well as mobile applications
-It is an open-source , reusable component-based front-end library
-React follows a one-way data flow, meaning data flows from parent components to child components.
-open source libaray for building user interface

=>JSX - JS + HTML
-React components are typically written using JSX, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.

=>component are the building blocks of any react application and a single app usually consists of multiple components.
-Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
-Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
-reusable modules known as components
-component also make it possible to write reusable code.

=>State is a component is an object that holds some data
=>Props is short of properties that allows us to pass argument or data to component
=>Props and State:-
Props (short for properties) and state are two fundamental concepts for managing data in React components. Props are used for passing data from parent to child components, while state is used for managing data that can change over time within a component. State changes trigger component re-rendering.

=>virtual DOM
-Make copy of actual DOM is called as virtual DOM
-The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy or representation of the actual DOM.
-React doesn't immediately update the actual DOM. Instead, it first updates the Virtual DOM and then compares it with the previous state to determine the minimal number of changes needed to update the real DOM. 

=>npm-download and use
=>npx-Use without download the package

=>Library and Framework
-A framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure for developing software applications.
-A library, on the other hand, is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks.


=>Single Page Application:-
-In a single-page application (SPA) built with React.js, the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code are loaded when the application is first accessed
-After that, the application typically runs entirely in the browser without the need for a full page reload.
- React js provides a powerful way to manage and update the content of a web page without having to reload the entire page.

=>Initial Loading time:-
-SPA have slight long initial Loading time. Because the application has load all the code (HTML,CSS,JS in one time(Framework))
